# Random Proxy List Generator
A python script to generate infinite random proxy lists for use.<br>Python version: 2.7x
# Usage
$ python proxy list.py<br>
How many times to run the collector?(Each time upto 35 proxies):<br>
30<br>
... {Displays proxy list}<br>
...<br>
It will print and as well as save in a new file in format<br>
<i>PROXY:PORT</i><br>
It will print list of proxies after sending a ping to the server first, so there is less possibility to get dead proxies instantly.<br>Changes on list generation varies depending on how often it is generated in target source.<br>
It has duplicate proxy identification system and so in your list, there will never be any proxy server repeated.<br>It may update list of proxies after every few seconds but I am not sure about it.
